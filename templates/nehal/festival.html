                <font style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">February 13</font><br>Shivaratri is great festival of convergence of Shiva and Shakti. Chaturdashi&nbsp; Tithi during Krishna Paksha in month of Magha is known as Maha Shivaratri according to South Indian calendar. But, according to North Indian calendar Masik Shivaratri in month of Phalguna is known as Maha Shivaratri. In both calendars, it is the naming convention of lunar month which differs. Both North Indians and South Indians celebrate Maha Shivaratri on the same day. <br><br>Vrat Vidhi – One day before Shivaratri Vratam, most likely on Trayodashi, devotees should eat only one time. On Shivaratri day, after finishing morning rituals devotees should take Sankalp for a full day fast on Shivaratri and should take food only the following day. During Sankalp, devotees pledge for self-determination throughout the fasting period and seeks the blessing of Lord Shiva to finish the fast without any interference. Hindu fasts are strict and people pledge for self-determination. They seek God blessing before starting them to finish them successfully. <br><br>On Shivaratri day, devotees should take second bath in the evening before doing Shiva Puja or visiting the temple. Shiva Puja should be done only during the night and devotees should break the fast the next day after taking bath. Devotees should break the fast between sunrise and before the end of Chaturdashi Tithi to get maximum benefit of the Vrat. According to one contradictory opinion devotees should break the fast only when Chaturdashi Tithi gets over. But it is believed that both Shiva Puja and Parana i.e. breaking the fast should be done within Chaturdashi&nbsp; Tithi. <br><br>Shivaratri puja can be performed either one time or four times during the night. The whole night duration can be divided into four to get four Prahar to perform Shiva Puja four times. Drikpanchang.com lists all four Prahar durations for staunch Shiva devotees who perform Shiva Pujan four times in the night. They also list Nishita time when Lord Shiva appeared on the Earth in the form of Linga and the time window to break the fast on next day. <br><br>Shivaratri is also spelled as Shivratri, Shivarathri and Sivaratri.

                <font style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">March 01</font><br>Masi Magam, also known as Maasi Makam, is a Tamil Hindu festival which is celebrated by Tamil speaking people. It is celebrated in the Tamil month “Masi” during the Makam Nakshatra. Usually Makam Nakshatra prevails during Pournami or on full moon day but that is not always true. Hence Masi Makam observation is not linked with full moon or Pournami but with Magha Nakshatra. Makam Nakshatra is also known as Magam and Magha. <br><br>On Masi Magam day, temple idols are taken in a procession to a water body - sea, pond or lake - for a ceremonial bath. It is believed that the devotees who flock the procession and take dips in the water body on this day would get rid of their sins. <br><br>Masi Magam is observed not only in India but also in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia.

               <font style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">March 01</font><br>Holi is a religious festival celebrated by Hindus all over the world. Holi is considered as the second biggest festival of the Hindu calendar after Diwali. Holi is also known as festival of Colors. <br><br>Places related to life of Lord Krishna are known as Braj regions. Holi rituals in Braj regions - Mathura, Vrindavan, Gowardhan, Gokul, Nandagaon and Barsana - are the most famous. Lathmar Holi – the traditional Holi festivity in Barsana is world famous. <br><br>In most regions Holi is celebrated for over two days. The first day is known as Jalanewali Holi - the day when Holi bonfire is done, and is also known as Chhoti Holi and Holi ka Dahan. Holika Dahan is referred to Kama Dahanam in South India. The second day is known as Rangwali Holi - the day when people play with coloured powder and coloured water. Rangwali Holi which is the main Holi day is also known as Dhulandi or Dhulendi. The other less popular pronunciations of Dhulandi are Dhuleti and Dhulheti. <br><br>On the first day, bonfires are lit after sunset at Right Holi ka Dahan Muhurta. The main Holi day when people actually play with colours is the next day of Holi ka Dahan or Holi bonfire. On that day, people play Holi with dry and wet colours in the morning. People are more willing and comfortable to play Holi with dry coloured powders which are known as Gulal. However many people feel that Holi celebrations are incomplete without wet colours. Wet colour is applied on the face and are made on the spot by mixing little amount of water with dry coloured powder. More enthusiastic Holi folk mix dry coloured powder in full bucket of water to drench their body completely in wet colour.

If Sankranthi takes place after sunset then the year begins on the following day. <br><br>This rule is good to start first day of the year for civil reckoning. However, auspicious time for Dan-Punya activities during Mesha Sankranthi is independent of all above rules and should be done after considering the exact moment of Sankranthi because only a small duration of time before and after Sankranthi moment is considered auspicious for Sankranthi related activities.
